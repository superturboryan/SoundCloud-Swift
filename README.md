A lightweight Swift package for working with the public SoundCloud API. It handles OAuth 2.1 and gives you convenient async/await APIs to access track, artist, and playlist data, as well as playable stream URLs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking change (v2.0.0):** SoundCloud migrated resource identifiers from numeric IDs to **string URNs**. Versions `< 2.0.0` of this package are not compatible with this change. Please update to `2.x` and audit any code that assumes numeric IDs. See [release PR](https://github.com/superturboryan/SoundCloud-Swift/pull/14) for more info.

## Features
- OAuth 2.1 authentication flow with **PKCE**
- Simple async/await interface
- Strongly-typed models for common SoundCloud entities
- Small surface area; focused on the essentials
- Works great in iOS/watchOS/macOS projects via Swift Package Manager

## Installation
`SoundCloud` is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://docs.swift.org/swiftpm/documentation/packagemanagerdocs/).   

Add this URL in **Xcode â†’ Package Dependencies** (or to your `Package.swift`):

```
https://github.com/superturboryan/SoundCloud-Swift/
```

## Setup
1. **Register your app** on SoundCloud to obtain a client identifier and configure redirect URIs.
2. **Define a custom URL scheme** in your app so the OAuth callback can return control to your app.

- Apple docs: [Defining a custom URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app)
- SoundCloud app management: [soundcloud.com/you/apps](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps)

> [!CAUTION]
> The redirect URI you use **when registering your app with SoundCloud** must match one of the redirect URIs configured for your SoundCloud app.

## Quick Start
Authenticate with a SoundCloud account:

```swift
import SoundCloud

let config = SoundCloud.Config(clientId: /* your client id */)
@StateObject var sc = SoundCloud(config)

// ... later, e.g. from a button tap
Task {
    do {
        try await sc.authenticate()
    } catch {
        // Handle login error
        print(error)
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples
Get the authenticated user's liked tracks:

```swift
let likedTracks = try await sc.likedTracks()
```

## Requirements
Access to the SoundCloud Public API requires a registered app and compliance with their terms:
- SoundCloud Public API specification: <https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/explorer/open-api>
- API Terms of Use: <https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use>

## Migration Notes
If you're upgrading from `< 2.0.0`, note the switch from numeric IDs to string **URNs** introduced by SoundCloud. Expect types touching `id` fields to change to `String`. Review any code paths that parse or store numeric IDs and update persistence accordingly. See: <https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/urn-num-to-string>.
