`SoundCloud` is a Swift Package that implements the [SoundCloud Public API Specification (v1.0.0) ](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/explorer/open-api). 

It handles the logic for authenticating with a SoundCloud account using the OAuth 2.1 standard, **including PKCE**, and provides an API for streaming audio and accessing track, artist, and playlist data from SoundCloud.

## Installation
Add the following line to your project's dependencies in the Package.swift file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/superturboryan/SoundCloud-api"),
```

and include "SoundCloud" as a dependency for your executable target:

```swift
.target(name: "Your App", dependencies: ["SoundCloud", ...]),
```

## Setup
[Define a custom URL scheme for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app), you will need to provide a redirect URI using the scheme so that the OAuth web page knows how to open your app when it receives the tokens callback.     
  
The redirect URI used when creating the `SoundCloud` instance must also be paired with the client ID and client secret for your [SoundCloud registered app](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps).

## Usage
To login using a SoundCloud account:

```swift
import SoundCloud

let config = SoundCloudConfig(clientId: ...)
@StateObject var sc = SoundCloud(config)  
  
...  

    
do {
    try await sc.login()
} catch {
    // Handle login error
}

```

To get the liked tracks for the authenticated user:

```swift
let likedTracks = try await sc.getMyLikedTracks()
```

## Example apps
This package is used by the third-party SoundCloud watchOS app **WatchCloud**, check it out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watchcloud/id6466678799) ðŸ“²


## Requirements
SoundCloud requires apps to be registered in order to access their public API. 
See [terms of use](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use).
